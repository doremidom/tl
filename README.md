Prerequisites:

Clone the project at https://github.com/doremidom/tl.git

Run 'npm install' on first run to install angular dependencies.

If you don't have json-server, run 'npm json-server' as well.

To Run:

Navigate to the project's root directory (/tl) and run 'npm start', as well as 'json-server --watch db.json' 
(in another tab)

If your host environment differs from below, you'll have to replace each instance with your relevant port mapping:

json-server: port 3000
http-server: port 8000
